# BiLSTM-GAN

This project generates music score, using a Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) based GAN model which is then converted to a MIDI file. Gathered training data from classical piano pieces and optimized the data by employing various metrics. It generated great music with limited training data by efficient training and elaborate testing methods. It was implemented in Python using the Tensorflow and Numpy frameworks.
